This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics module. The player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail.

Features

Responsive Controls: Use the arrow keys for smooth and responsive snake movement.

Dynamic Food Placement: Food appears at random positions on the screen after being eaten.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score, which increases each time the snake eats food.

Game Over Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own tail, displaying a game over message.

Smooth Animations: The game runs with smooth animations and a consistent frame rate for a better gaming experience.

Expandable Code: Modular code structure allows for easy addition of new features and enhancements.
